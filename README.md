# Drug Classification Using Naive Bayes Algorithm
## Introduction
Medication prescription plays a crucial role in healthcare, ensuring patients receive the most effective treatment based on their medical conditions. However, selecting the appropriate drug for a patient depends on several factors, including age, sex, blood pressure levels, cholesterol levels, and the sodium-to-potassium ratio in the body. In this study, we leverage machine learning techniques to classify drugs based on these patient attributes, aiming to improve accuracy in medication recommendations.

The dataset used in this project contains information about different drug types and their corresponding patient profiles. The target variable is the drug type, while the feature set includes age, sex, blood pressure levels (BP), cholesterol levels, and sodium-to-potassium ratio. By applying classification algorithms, we aim to develop a predictive model that can assist in recommending the most suitable drug for a patient.

As a beginner-friendly machine learning problem, this project provides an excellent opportunity to explore different classification techniques, evaluate their performance, and understand key challenges in predictive modeling for healthcare applications. The approach taken in solving this problem will not only enhance our understanding of machine learning concepts but also contribute to the broader field of medical decision support systems.
## Nayes Bayes Algorithm
The Naïve Bayes algorithm is a probabilistic classification technique based on Bayes' Theorem. It assumes that the features are independent of each other, making it a "naïve" assumption. Despite this simplification, Naïve Bayes performs well in many real-world applications, especially in text classification, spam detection, and medical diagnosis. The algorithm calculates the probability of each class given the input features and selects the class with the highest probability. It is computationally efficient, works well with small datasets, and is particularly useful for categorical data.

The dataset used in this project contains information about different drug types and their corresponding patient profiles. The target variable is the drug type, while the feature set includes age, sex, blood pressure levels (BP), cholesterol levels, and sodium-to-potassium ratio. 

| **Column Name**        | **Description**                                              |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Age**               | The age of the patient (numerical).                          |
| **Sex**               | The gender of the patient (`Male` or `Female`).              |
| **BP (Blood Pressure)** | The blood pressure level of the patient (`Low`, `Normal`, `High`). |
| **Cholesterol**       | The cholesterol level of the patient (`Normal`, `High`).     |
| **Na to Potassium Ratio** | The ratio of sodium to potassium in the blood (numerical). |
| **Drug Type**         | The type of drug prescribed to the patient (target variable). |

The target variable in this dataset is "Drug Type," which represents the medication prescribed based on patient attributes.Different types of drug are:

**✔ DrugY**

**✔ DrugX**

**✔ DrugA**

**✔ DrugC**

**✔ DrugB**

By applying classification algorithms, we aim to develop a predictive model that can assist in recommending the most suitable drug for a patient.
##  **Step-by-Step Implementation of Naive Bayes Algorithm**

### **1️⃣ Data Loading & Preprocessing**  
- **Reading the dataset** and inspecting its structure.  
- **Checking for missing values**   
- **Encoding categorical variables**
- **A pie chart or barchart is drawn using matplotlib to visualize the distribution of categorical variables in the dataset.**

---

### **2️⃣ Splitting Data into Features & Target Variable**  
- **Defining the feature matrix (x)**, which includes all predictor variables.  
- **Defining the target variable (y)**, which contains the type of drug required.

---

### **3️⃣ Splitting Data into Training & Testing Sets**  
- **Dividing the dataset** into **70% training data and 30% testing data** using stratified sampling to ensure an even distribution of classes.  

---

### **4️⃣ Feature Scaling Using Standardization**    
- **StandardScaler** is applied to ensure all features have equal weight in distance computation.  

---

### **5️⃣ Training the Naive Bayes Model**  
- Use the Bernoulli Naïve Bayes classifier, which is suitable for binary feature datasets. Train the model using the training data, where it learns the probability distribution of each binary feature in relation to different drug classifications. The model then applies Bayes' Theorem to predict the most probable drug type for new patient data.
---

### **6️⃣ Making Predictions on Test Data**  
- Once the model is trained, use it to predict drug types for the test data. The model assigns probabilities to each drug type and selects the one with the highest probability.  

---

### **7️⃣ Evaluating Model Performance**  

#### **Confusion Matrix Analysis** ,**Accuracy Score & Classification Report**  
-Assess the model’s performance using metrics such as accuracy, classification report (precision, recall, F1-score), and confusion matrix. These metrics help determine how well the model is classifying different drug types.
- The **confusion matrix** provides insights into **true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives**.  
- The **accuracy score** is computed to evaluate the overall performance of the model.  
- A **classification report** is generated, providing **precision, recall, and F1-score**.

## **Conclusion**  
                                    
In this project, we successfully implemented a **Naïve Bayes classifier** to predict drug types based on patient attributes such as **age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and sodium-to-potassium ratio**.By using Bernoulli Naïve Bayes we effectively handled both numerical and categorical data, achieving a reliable classification model. The model’s performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix, demonstrating its effectiveness in drug classification. This project highlights the power of **machine learning in healthcare**, offering a data-driven approach to assist in medication recommendations.
